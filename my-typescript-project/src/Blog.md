"The significance of union and intersection types in Typescript."


Answer is ------------

Some of the key concepts in TypeScript are Union and Intersection types. Union Type(|): Union type gives the permissions for a value to be one out of many types. This is utilized when any one type of value can be assigned out of many types. For example, string | number means the value can be either a string or a number.

Intersection Type (&): It merges more types into one type. It is used when a value needs to possess all properties of more types. For example, A & B means that this value must contain all the properties of both A and B.

The Union type allows a value to be one of several types. The Intersection type requires a value to have all the properties of multiple types.
